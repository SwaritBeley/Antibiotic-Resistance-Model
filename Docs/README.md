## Introduction

The Antibiotic Resistance Model uses image-based detection from disk diffusion plates to predict a percentage of resistance among 16 different antibiotics.

- The dataset is from https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.5dv41nsfj

- The dataset is split up into rectangular sections in order to isolate each antibiotic
